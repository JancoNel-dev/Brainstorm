### 1. **Data Exfiltration and Obfuscation Tools**

- **Data Handling**: Ensure your tool can handle various data types and sizes. Implement robust encryption and obfuscation methods to secure the data during transfer.
- **Exfiltration Channels**: Consider using unconventional channels like DNS queries, HTTP/HTTPS traffic, or cloud storage services. Implement techniques for fragmenting and reassembling data to evade detection.
- **Testing**: Test your tool in different environments to ensure compatibility and effectiveness. Use sandbox environments to validate your obfuscation techniques.

### 2. **Post-Exploitation Cleanup and Evasion**

- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Develop scripts or tools that can automate the cleanup process, including removing traces from logs, restoring system settings, and disabling or re-enabling security features.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Implement features to hide your cleanup activities from detection mechanisms. Consider adding options for customizing the cleanup based on the system's configuration.
- **Testing**: Ensure your tool is versatile and can adapt to different security setups and monitoring tools. Test it thoroughly to ensure it effectively removes traces of compromise.

### 3. **Automated Post-Exploitation Reporting**

- **Data Collection**: Focus on gathering comprehensive data, including system information, security software details, and recent activity logs. Ensure your tool can interface with various system components and security tools.
- **Reporting**: Create customizable report templates that can present the collected data in a useful and understandable format. Include options for exporting reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
- **Analysis**: Implement features for analyzing collected data, such as identifying installed security software, detecting signs of compromise, and summarizing system status.
